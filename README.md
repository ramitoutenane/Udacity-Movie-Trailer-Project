- Select "Open" from "File" menu
	- you can also use the shortcut (Ctrl+O)

**Next time you can open the web-page only by double clicking on  (movie_trailers.html)**

## Extra Work
**Some of the work i have done above the minimal requirements:**
 
 - **data.json:**
	 - created json file to store movie ratings html code from imdb because if it was added directly it would affect the readability of the code.
	 - added all movie data to json file. (Udacity reviewer Note) .
 
 - **media .py:**
	 - added **rerelease_year** and **imdb_data_title** to be stored in the object

- **entertainment_center.py**:
	- read the data from json file to create Movie instances and store them in array using a for loop .

- **edited_fresh_tomatoes.py:**
	- edited the code to include the new data (year and rating)
	- edited the code to change html and css code
	- edited the code to create 2 extra files (readme.html , style.css)

- **HTML & Css:**
	- moved style to separate file (style.css) to improve the readability and to make it work with both pages 
	- changed the original page style and look
	-  included year and rating into page
	- created README page (the first page came to my mind)
	- linked two pages (Movie trailer and README)
